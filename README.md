## INTRODUCTION

I made a functional Cache Bank portfolio piece where I included HTML, CSS and Javascript challenges.

**CHALLENGES FACED**
The lengthy CSS fonts that I needed to type out. At first i had an issues with navigation bar was not working and I was able to fix my JavaScript.

**WHAT I LEARNED**
I Learnt that i can do both CSS and javascript inside HTML. I also learnt how to make the navigation bar functional. I learnt the use of grid columns and flebox on how and where to put them.
