INTRODUCTION

CHALLENGES FACED
- The lengthy CSS fonts that I needed to type out. At first i had an issues with navigation bar was not working and I was able to fix my JavaScript.

WHAT I LEARNED
- I Learnt that i can do both CSS and javascript inside HTML. I also learnt how to make the navigation bar functional. I learnt the use of grid columns and flebox on how and where to put them.
